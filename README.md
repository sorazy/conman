This is the repo that contains all of the source code of our Contact Manager web application. 

Please go to this link to check it out!

Guide:
1) If this is your first time visiting the website, start by signing up and making an account.
2) After that, log in using the username and password that you just created.
3) You will be greeted by an empty contact list. This is the part where you begin adding contacts!
4) You can search contacts using the search bar at the top right, and delete contacts by clicking the delete button.
